Forest Woods

Inspired in No Man Sky and The Forest, this project is an exploration of the concept both these videogames exploit at their best but mixing it altogether.

The videogame is inspired thematically in The Forest and technically in No Man Sky. The forest Has one of the best atmosphere
and IA behaviour I have ever seen in a videogame and No Man Sky has the best procedural generation ever seen. This project
is just an exploration of what both of these great games have done but mixing both concepts.

I'll be updating the code, putting it all clean and simple and developing and cleaning libraries for game development. This project is just a sandbox to explore 
and develop such libraries.
