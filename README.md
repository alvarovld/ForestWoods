Forest Woods

This is a place where I'll be updating the development of the videogame inspired in The Forest.

What does ForestWoods (temporal name) make it different fro The Forest? The whole game is procedurally generated.

The videogame is inspired thematically in The Forest and technically in No Man Sky. The forest Has one of the best atmosphere
and IA behaviour I have ever seen in a videogame and No Man Sky has the best procedural generation ever seen. This project
is just an exploration of what both of these great games have done but mixing both concepts.
